<h1>Rider</h1>
<p>Riders are users who do not have a car and need a ride to their local supermarket and do not want to pay for a taxi or take public transport.</p>
<p>Riders treat Szchober similarly as they would with a taxi service but Szchober is far cheaper! Riders can choose a location and their driver and then wait to be collected.</p>
